# Quick start project automation

Git-init-automation helped me further learn technologies like Selenium Webdriver, sqlite and windows batch files. 

The git-init-automation application will be able to create project folder with specified name, navigate through github website, sign in, and and upload project as a repository. 

## Road-map

- Navigate to github login page
- Login into github
- Create repositiory with same name as project folder
- Copy remote github repository link
- Connect project folder to remote repository
