# Quick start project automation

Git-init-automation helped me further learn technologies like Selenium Webdriver, sqlite and windows batch files. 

The git-init-automation application will be able to create project folder with specified name, navigate through github website, sign in, and and upload project as a repository. 

## Get started

Install Python latest version - https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install all modules used in the software:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Create `txt` file with your github username on the first line and your password on the second line. This will be used to naviate through the browser and login to github. *Will only be kept in your computer and will not be shared publicly*

Lastly run `main.py` to start the software as demonstrated below:
```
py main.py
```
